# ðŸ“¦ Semaphore Merkle Tree Batcher (SMTB)

SMTB is a service for batch processing of Merkle tree updates. It is designed to be used in conjunction with [Semaphore](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore). It accepts Merkle tree updates and batches them together into a single one. This is useful for reducing the number of transactions that need to be submitted to the blockchain. The correctness of the batched Merkle tree update is assured through the generation of a SNARK (generated through [gnark](https://github.com/ConsenSys/gnark)).

## Usage

This part explains the existing cli commands.

1. setup - builds a circuit with provided batch size and depth, compiles it and writes it to a file.  
   Flags:
   1. output _file path_ - A path used to output a file
   2. tree-depth _n_ - Merkle tree depth
   3. batch-size _n_ - Batch size for Merkle tree updates
2. export-solidity - Reads a key file (generated from setup), and writes a solidity verifier contract.  
   Flags:
   1. keys-file _file path_
   2. Optional: output _file_ - Outputs to a file, if not provided, it will output to stdandard output
3. gen-test-params - Generates test params given the batch size and tree depth.
   Flags:
   1. tree-depth _n_ - Depth of the mock merkle tree
   2. batch-size _n_ - Batch size for merkle tree updates
4. start - starts a api server with /prove and /metrics endpoints  
   Flags:
   1. keys-file _file path_ - Proving system file
   2. Optional: json-logging _0/1_ - Enables json logging
   3. Optional: prover-address _address_ - Address for the prover server, defaults to localhost:3001
   4. Optional: metrics-address _address_ - Address for the metrics server, defaults to localhost:9998
5. prove - Reads a prover system file, generates and returns proof based on prover parameters  
   Flags:
   1. keys-file _file path_ - Proving system file
6. verify - Takes a hash of all public inputs and verifies it with a prover system  
   Flags:
   1. keys-file _file path_ - Proving system file
   2. input-hash _hash_ - Hash of all public inputs
7. r1cs - Builds an r1cs and writes it to a file  
   Flags:
   1. output _file path_ - File to be written to
   2. tree-depth _n_ - Depth of a tree
   3. batch-size _n_ - Batch size for Merkle tree updates
8. extract-circuit - Transpiles the circuit from gnark to Lean
   Flags:
   1. output _file path_ - File to be writen to 2. tree-depth _n_ - Merkle tree depth
   2. batch-size _n_ - Batch size for Merkle tree updates
9. convert-to-raw - Converts a compressed proving system into an uncompressed one with better read performance
   Flags:
   1. input _file path_ - Input proving system
   2. output _file path_ - Output proving system

## Benchmarks

```

## Running

```shell
go build .
gnark-mbu --keys-file path/to/keys/file
```

## Docker

```shell
docker build -t semaphore-mtb .

# /host/path/to/mtb should contain the keys file
docker run -it \
    --mount type=bind,source=host/path/to/mtb,target=/mtb \
    -p 3001:3001 \
    semaphore-mtb
```

Or in docker compose

```yaml
semaphore-mtb:
    # Path to the repo root directory
    build: ./semaphore-mtb
    volumes:
        - /host/path/to/mtb:/mtb
    ports:
        # Server
        - "3001:3001"
        # Metrics
        - "9998:9998"

docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```
